## Project Overview
<a name="snapshot"></a>
## ðŸŽ¯ <span style="font-size:1.6rem;">Project Snapshot</span>
PremiumSense is an analytics project for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS), using South African car insurance data (Feb 2014 â€“ Aug 2015) to:
- Identify low-risk client segments for targeted premium reduction,
- Inform marketing strategies with data-driven insights,
  ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44414588-d258-4455-aaf2-45f56b7e2692)

- Build robust predictive models for dynamic, risk-based pricing.

This repository contains all code, notebooks, and documentation for the full end-to-end workflow:
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis (EDA)
- Rigorous data version control (DVC)
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Machine learning modeling (regression, classification)
- Model interpretation and business recommendations

---

## Notebooks & Structure

- **EDA.ipynb:** Data profiling, visualization, and initial business insights
- **Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb:** Statistical analysis for risk segmentation
- **Modeling.ipynb:** Predictive modeling and SHAP-based explainability

Supporting code modules are found in the `scripts/` folder.

## Key Insights (So Far)

- **Loss ratios** vary sharply by region and vehicle segment.
- **Outlier capping** and proper imputation greatly improved data quality.
- **DVC** enables full auditability of all data versions and processed outputs.
- Initial models show promise for targeted premium optimization.
